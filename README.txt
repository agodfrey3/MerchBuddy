#README

-----DESCRIPTION-----
This is a project which scrapes the item price data from each tradeable item in Runescape and places it into a MYSQL Database located on a server local to this project, which is then analyzed to find the best item(s) for merching, as well as other various information that can be drawn from price trends. 

-------NOTES-------
8-9-2016
Justin Auger has created a MySQL insertion script that will take the information found by the scrape2.py script and place it into a table located on our server. Justin's script has not been uploaded yet, which is why there is an import in scrape2.py that looks foreign. I have added a credential hiding system to Justin's script, however, so it will be uploaded shortly. The scrape2.py script is working, but, will continue to be improved as I find ways to do so.
